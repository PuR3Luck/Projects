- This folder contains programs for a Canteen Queue Wait Time Estimator Program.
- It uses the YOLOv5 crowdhuman model to count the number of people in a queue.
- The actual programs in use have been modified to work with Raspberry Pis and have other modifications, so the programs here have not have been extensively tested and may have issues
- There are 2 implementations, one using socket and the other using Flask.
- Note:Implementation using Flask is a WIP(it was started to allow students to access from a webpage so they do not need to go to the canteen to see the estimates)
