- This folder contains programs for a Canteen Queue Wait Time Estimator Program.
- It uses the YOLOv5 crowdhuman model to count the number of people in a queue.
- There are 2 implementations, one using socket and the other using Flask.
- Note:Implementation using Flask is a WIP(it was started to allow students to access from a webpage so they do not need to go to the canteen to see the estimates)
